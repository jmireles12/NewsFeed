# NewsFeed

Welcome to NewsFeed where you can add Tabs and display news containing the name of the Tabs. I created this website to make searching news a little bit easier. Instead of having different tabs in your browser where you could get different articles or blogs, NewsFeed will only show you news and you can go back and forward from tha Tabs that you created from the drop down.
