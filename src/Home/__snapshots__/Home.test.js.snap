    Welcome to NewsFeed where you can add Tabs and display news containing the name of the Tabs. I created this website to make searching for news a little bit easier. Instead of having different tabs in your browser where you could get different articles or blogs, NewsFeed will only show you news and you can go back and forward from the Tabs that you created from the drop-down. In 'My News' just press the edit button and you'll be able to create a tab with the name of your choosing.
